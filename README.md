In this first milestone, I reconfigured my Kali VM to run on bridged mode and ran a `ifconfig` command to verify the machine recieved a 192.168.x.x IP address. 

## Milestone 1: Hello, SET

In this milestone, I installed SET and used it to send my throwaway email a phishing test email displayed above. 

## Milestone 2: Try a Real Payload

In this milestone, I again tried sending a test phishing email to myself but this time using a payload. However, GMail has secuirty features that look out for signatures within attachments and my test email was not able to be sent as the error displays above. The goal here was to see how it takes more than a sript kiddie to send a spear phishing email attack nowadays.
